## Can you break the loop?

Welcome to the repository for **ParadoxRun**, a co-op multiplayer puzzle game built in Unreal Engine. Developed by a passionate team, this game challenges players to communicate and collaborate to solve a series of escape-room-style puzzles under a strict time limit. The twist? When time runs out, the loop resets‚Äîsending players back to the start and resetting all the puzzles.

### üèÜ My Role: Lead Gameplay Programmer

As the lead programmer for the core systems, my primary responsibility was to build the entire gameplay experience from the ground up. While my teammates focused on assets and interactions, I engineered the systems that made ParadoxRun a functional game. Specifically, I:

* **Developed the Core Game Logic:** I single-handedly designed and programmed all major gameplay mechanics, including the player character controller and movement systems.
* **Engineered the Time-Loop System:** I was solely responsible for the signature time-loop feature. This involved writing the logic to manage the game timer, reset player positions, and revert all puzzle states to their original configuration upon the loop's activation.
* **Built the Puzzle Framework:** I created the underlying technical framework for the puzzles that my teammates could then use to build their interaction scenarios.
